## üìê Design Patterns Used

### 1. Factory Method
Enables easy creation of different types of objects (e.g., `ShoppingItem`, `State`) without relying on specific classes. Boosts extensibility when new types are introduced.

### 2. State
Simplifies behavior management by encapsulating the item's state (e.g., "Active", "Purchased"). Each state has its unique behavior, improving scalability.

### 3. Observer
Ensures reactivity by synchronizing changes in the shopping list with the application's UI. Helps maintain a dynamic interface.

### 4. Command
Encapsulates user actions as "commands" with undo/redo capabilities. Ensures a robust interaction system while tracking the history of actions.

### 5. Decorator
Adds priority functionality to items by wrapping them in `PrioritizedItem`. Allows extending capabilities without modifying the base class.
